  Challenge: To double an integer and return the result
  
  P - strictly an integer
  R - return, not console.log(), the double
  E - if integer is 4, returbn 8;
         integer is 50, return 100;
         integer is 1250, return 2500.
  
  P - could store the value of the integer double in a variable and then return the result, or return the result of the double straight up

function doubleInteger(i) {
    //   const integerDouble = i*2
    //   return integerDouble;
    
    return i*2
}

// Good thing my code was on top of pressure, I don't think I would have completed it under pressure, PHEWWWWW!!
// PRESSUUUREEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
